       <h2>Culture</h2>
         
        <h3>Cuisine</h3>
         <p>Cuisine varies by region, but a large, one-course, evening meal is common throughout the country. 
            A typical dish is based on cocoyams, maize, cassava (manioc), millet, plantains, potatoes, rice, or 
            yams, often pounded into dough-like fufu. This is served with a sauce, soup, or stew made from greens, 
            groundnuts, palm oil, or other ingredients.[201] Meat and fish are popular but expensive additions, with 
            chicken often reserved for special occasions.[202] Dishes are often quite spicy; seasonings include salt, 
            red pepper sauce, and maggi. <br>

            Cutlery is common, but food is traditionally manipulated with the right hand. Breakfast consists of leftovers 
            of bread and fruit with coffee or tea. Generally, breakfast is made from wheat flour in different foods such as 
            puff-puff (doughnuts), accra banana made from bananas and flour, bean cakes, and many more. Snacks are popular, 
            especially in larger towns where they may be bought from street vendors</p>

        <h3>Fashion</h3>
        <p>Cameroon's relatively large and diverse population is likewise diverse in its fashions. Climate, religious, ethnic, 
         and cultural beliefs, and the influences of colonialism, imperialism, and globalisation are all factors in contemporary 
         Cameroonian dresses. Noteworthy Cameroonian dresses include Pagnes, sarongs worn by Cameroon women; Chechia, a traditional 
         hat; kwa, a male handbag; and Gandura, male custom attire.[208] Wrappers and loincloths are used extensively by both women 
         and men but their use varies by region, with influences from Fulani styles more present in the north and Igbo and Yoruba 
         styles more often in the south and west.[209] Imane Ayissi is one of Cameroon's most prominent fashion designers and has 
         received international recognition.</p>

         <h3>Sports</h3>
         <p>Sport in Cameroon is dominated by football. Amateur football clubs abound, organised along ethnic lines or under corporate sponsors. The national team has been one of the most successful in Africa since its strong showing in the 1982 and 1990 FIFA World Cups. Cameroon has won five African Cup of Nations titles and the gold medal at the 2000 Olympics</p>
         <p>Cameroon was the host country of the Women Africa Cup of Nations in November–December 2016,[224] the 2020 African Nations Championship and the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. The women's football team is known as the "Indomitable Lionesses", and like their men's counterparts, are also successful on the international stage, although it has not won any major trophy.</p>
         <p>National policy strongly advocates sport in all forms. Traditional sports include canoe racing and wrestling, and several hundred runners participate in the 40 km (25 mi) Mount Cameroon Race of Hope each year.[222] Cameroon is one of the few tropical countries to have competed in the Winter Olympics.</p>

         <h3>Religion</h3>
         <p>Cameroon has a high level of religious freedom and diversity.[80] The majority faith is Christianity, practised by about two-thirds of the population, while Islam is a significant minority faith, adhered to by about one-fourth. In addition, traditional faiths are practised by many. Muslims are most concentrated in the north, while Christians are concentrated primarily in the southern and western regions, but practitioners of both faiths can be found throughout the country.[165] Large cities have significant populations of both groups.[165] Muslims in Cameroon are divided into Sufis, Salafis,[166] Shias, and non-denominational Muslims</p>
         <p>People from the North-West and South-West provinces, which used to be a part of British Cameroons, have the highest proportion of Protestants. The French-speaking regions of the southern and western regions are largely Catholic.[165] Southern ethnic groups predominantly follow Christian or traditional African animist beliefs or a syncretic combination of the two. People widely believe in witchcraft, and the government outlaws such practices.[168] Suspected witches are often subject to mob violence.[80] The Islamist jihadist group Ansar al-Islam has been reported as operating in North Cameroon.</p>
         <p>In the northern regions, the locally dominant Fulani ethnic group is almost completely Muslim, but the overall population is fairly evenly divided among Muslims, Christians, and followers of indigenous religious beliefs (called Kirdi ("pagan") by the Fulani).[165] The Bamum ethnic group of the West Region is largely Muslim.[165] Native traditional religions are practised in rural areas throughout the country but rarely are practised publicly in cities, in part because many indigenous religious groups are intrinsically local.</p>
