            <h1>ABOUT CAMEROON</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p><strong>Cameroon</strong>, known as the "Africa in Miniature," is a vibrant country located at the crossroads of West and Central Africa. It covers an area of about 475,000 square kilometers and has a population of nearly 28 million people (2025 estimate). Its capital city is Yaoundé, and the official languages are French and English, reflecting its colonial past.</p>

        <p>Cameroon boasts incredible geographic diversity including deserts, mountains, rainforests, and coastal plains, which together create a rich natural environment.</p>
        
        <p>Its population includes more than 250 ethnic groups, with major communities such as the Bamileke, Bamum, Duala, and Fulani. The country is culturally rich and religiously diverse, with Christianity, Islam, and traditional beliefs practiced widely.</p>

        <p>Cameroon's economy is developing steadily, driven mainly by petroleum, agriculture (coffee, cocoa, cotton), timber, and a growing services sector. It enjoys relative political stability as a unitary multiparty republic, though some regions face challenges from ongoing unrest.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <h3>Early history</h3>
        <p>Evidence from digs at Shum Laka in the Northwest Region shows human occupation in Cameroon dating back 30,000 years.[15][16] The longest continuous inhabitants are groups such as the Baka (Pygmies).[17] From there, Bantu migrations into eastern, southern and central Africa are believed to have occurred about 2,000 years ago.[18] The Sao culture arose around Lake Chad, c. 500 CE, and gave way to the Kanem and its successor state, the Bornu Empire. Kingdoms, fondoms, and chiefdoms arose in the west</p>
        <p>Portuguese sailors reached the coast in 1472. They noted an abundance of the ghost shrimp Lepidophthalmus turneranus in the Wouri River and named it Rio dos Camarões (Shrimp River), which became Cameroon in English.[20] Over the following few centuries, European interests regularised trade with the coastal peoples, and Christian missionaries pushed inland.[21]</p>
        <P>In 1896, Sultan Ibrahim Njoya created the Bamum script, or Shu Mom, for the Bamum language.[22][23] It is taught in Cameroon today by the Bamum Scripts and Archives Project</P>
        
        <h3>German rule</h3>
        <p>Germany began to establish roots in Cameroon in 1868 when the Woermann Company of Hamburg built a warehouse. It was built on the estuary of the Wouri River. Later, Gustav Nachtigal made a treaty with one of the local kings to annex the region for the German emperor.[24] The German Empire claimed the territory as the colony of Kamerun in 1884 and began a steady push inland; the natives resisted. Under the aegis of Germany, commercial companies were local administrations. These concessions used forced labour to run profitable banana, rubber, palm oil, and cocoa plantations.[24] Even infrastructure projects relied on a regimen of forced labour. This economic policy was much criticised by the other colonial powers.</p>
        
        <h3>French and British rule</h3>
        <p>On 1 October 1961, the formerly British Southern Cameroons gained independence from the United Kingdom by vote of the UN General Assembly and merged into the Republic of Cameroon to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon. The federal republic was composed of two federated states, East Cameroon and West Cameroon, each with its own legislature, government, and prime minister. 1 October is now observed as Unification Day, a public holiday.[31] Ahidjo used the ongoing war with the UPC to concentrate power in the presidency, continuing with this even after the suppression of the UPC in 1971.</p>
        <h3>Independence</h3>
        <p>On 1 January 1960, French Cameroun gained independence from France under President Ahmadou Ahidjo as the Republic of Cameroon</p>

        <h2>ECONOMY AND INFRASTRUCTURE</h2>

        <p>Cameroon's per capita GDP (Purchasing power parity) was estimated at US$3,700 in 2017. Major export markets include the Netherlands, France, China, Belgium, Italy, Algeria, and Malaysia</p>
        <p>Cameroon has its GDP growing at an average of 4% per year. During the 2004–2008 period, public debt was reduced from over 60% of GDP to 10% and official reserves quadrupled to over US$3 billion.[108] Cameroon is part of the Bank of Central African States (of which it is the dominant economy),[109] the Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa (UDEAC) and the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (OHADA).[110] Its currency is the CFA franc</p>
        <p>Unemployment was estimated at 3.38% in 2019,[111] and 23.8% of the population was living below the international poverty threshold of US$1.90 a day in 2014.[112] Since the late 1980s, Cameroon has been following programmes advocated by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reduce poverty, privatise industries, and increase economic growth.[57] The government has taken measures to encourage tourism in the country.</p>
